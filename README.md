# wrap

"_because sharing files is a PITA._"

Wrap serves up 1 file over HTTP on the port of your choosing. Then it exits.
Download the binary for your platform, and put it in your system's PATH.

## Usage:

#### Linux: `wrap -port 8081 /tmp/some-file`

#### Windows: `wrap.exe -port 8081 c:\src\wrap\wrap.go`
