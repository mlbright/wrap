* [Graceful](https://github.com/tylerb/graceful) is a library that wraps the Golang std library net/http objects
for graceful shutdown.
* Another [approach](http://www.hydrogen18.com/blog/stop-listening-http-server-go.html) that uses a key idea: define a new
error in the net.Listener Accept() function.
* [Manners](https://github.com/braintree/manners) is what was used, but not necessary.
* [Discussion on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/qt3ABSpKjzM) led to Gustavo Niemeyer's approach
being used. No need for third party libraries. The difficult part is limiting the number of connections. Shutting down the
server is just a question of wrapping the Accept() function in net.Listener().
